<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year M.S. student at SKKU (Sungkyunkwan University), South Korea, advised by <a href='https://www.csehong.com/'>Prof. Sungeun Hong</a> in the Artificial Intelligence and Media Lab (<a href='https://aim.skku.edu/home'>AIM Lab</a>). My research focuses on building robust and adaptive AI through multimodal learning and test-time adaptation. I have proposed novel frameworks for semantic segmentation and classification under domain shifts, leveraging class-wise alignment and adaptive thresholding. Recently, I introduced a question-aware temporal reasoning model for audio-visual question answering, which integrates Gaussian experts and modality interaction. My recent work expands into audio-visual reasoning and zero-shot test-time adaptation via prompt-based modality fusion.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a>  -->
